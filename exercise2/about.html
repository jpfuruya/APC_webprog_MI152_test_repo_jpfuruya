		Hey There I'm Rafael a college student currently taking BS in Information </br>
		Technology major in mobile and internet. I'm half Japanese half Filipino </br>
		born and raised here in the Philippines. My friends and block mates used </br>
		to call me Raf and Furuys, but you guys can call me anything you want.</br>
		Both of my parents are in Japan and I'm only with my sister at home whose</br>
		also a college student like me. So yeah basically me and my sister are </br>
		kinda Independent , cause we have no choice and we need to, in order to </br>
		live. Another thing we don't have yaya's or kasambahay at home. </br>
		
		</br>
		</br>
		
		
		Hobbies uhhm it's kinda weird because aside for programming what I did </br>
		when I have a free time is usually spending my time in social Media </br>
		like Twitter, but not facebook haha I do hate facebook. Blogging in my </br>
		Tumblr account has also became my habby. Lately , I'm currently in to </br>
		Photo editing through the use of Photoshop, It started with my design </br>
		subject such as artapre and GUI programming and after a while it </br>
		became a hobby of mine , weird is'nt it? </br>
		
		</br>
		</br>
		
		Aside from that, I'm also interested on handheld console especially </br>
		devices that were made by Nintendo. I'm a big fan of Super Mario and </br>
		Pokemon games. I like travelling especially with my friends. I feel </br>
		recharged and free when I'm with them. Occasionally read books when I</br>
		Do feel like reading one.</br>
		</br>
	
		That's it , I just want to keep it simple and short.
		</br>
		Hope you Have a wonderful time reading!
